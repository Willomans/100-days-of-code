# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started off with the introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5. I took the following challenges: HTML Elements, Headline with the h2 Element, Inform with the Paragraph Element, Fill in the Blank with Placeholder Text, Uncomment HTML, Comment out HTML, Delete HTML Elements, Introduction to HTML5 Elements, Add Images to Your Website, Link to External Pages with Anchor Elements, Link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements and Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph

**Thoughts:** Found it really interesting and refreshing.
